# ft_printf

**ft_printf is a project where you have to reimplement the printf function with support for certain flags (like `%s`, `%i`, etc.).  
The main goal of this project is to help us understand how to handle variable-length arguments.  
Afterward, we need to compile the code into a static library `.a`.**
